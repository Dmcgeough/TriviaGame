# TriviaGame
The task for this week was to createa trivia game using the big three languages of web development. Since I have a masters degree in European History, I decided to focus on World War II as my trivia subject. I came up with thirty questions of very high difficulty for the user to answer. So first I assigned each question a variable and created an array for each questions which contained the answer and four multiple choice answers of which one was the correct. I then put these question arrays, inside of another array. I then gave the user a timer of 90 seconds with which the user would answer as many questions correctly. To make it easier the questions would be displayed randomly so if you got a question correct and remembered the answer you could enhance your score or get another shot at one you got wrong. You would have to pay attention though because the position of the right answer would change and be in a new order in the four choices the next time. After picking your answer for the first question it would tell you whether you were correct or not and display the questions for three seconds and then create a new question. This would continue until the 90 second timer ran out after which an alert would come up displaying your score. The object was to beat my score of thirty. Arrays and functions were the primary focuse of this game.
Tools Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
